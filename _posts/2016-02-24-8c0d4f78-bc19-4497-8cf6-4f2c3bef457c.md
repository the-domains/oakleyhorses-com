**Experience competing and training...**

Stephan has show-jumped in Canada at international level successfully with the Hannoverian elite stallion Rio Grande and ex PSI horse Lavinia, competed in dressage at Prix St. George level in Florida U.S.A. and given clinics in Miami, New York, the Bahamas and, of course, Germany and Ireland.

Most of the Stephan success stories have been with retraining and reeducating horses that had adopted bad habits. Balance and fairness breeds success.

**Background...**

In 1997 at Warendorf in Germany, Stephan completed the tough three year state apprenticeship to become a Bereiter FN. During this time he worked at Klosterhof Medingen, famous for some of the world's best dressage sires and Elite Riding Horse Auctions. He then trained with top eventers Andreas Dibowski and Claus Erhorn at Luhmuhlen and show jumper Ronald Sandbrink helping to produce their top class young horses and worked as head rider for a dressage stud farm in Germany. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/754b4dea-4793-4561-a4e9-74850bff2137.png)
